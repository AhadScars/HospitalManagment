### **Hospital Management System**

**Technologies Used:**
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **RESTful APIs**

**Overview:**
The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive, user-friendly application designed to streamline the management of hospital operations. It allows efficient handling of various aspects such as patient appointments, doctor schedules, and hospital information. This system ensures that the workflow within a hospital is optimized by providing centralized and real-time data access to healthcare staff.

**Key Features:**

- **Appointment Management:**
  - The system allows users to schedule, update, and delete appointments.
  - Each appointment is linked to specific patients, doctors, and hospitals, ensuring accurate tracking of healthcare services provided.

- **Doctor Management:**
  - Doctors can be added, updated, and removed from the system.
  - The system stores and organizes doctor details, enabling easy scheduling of appointments and doctor-patient interactions.

- **Hospital Management:**
  - Hospitals can be added, updated, or deleted from the system.
  - The application helps manage multiple hospital locations and track patient appointments for each facility.

- **Patient Management:**
  - Patient information can be added, viewed, and deleted from the system.
  - Each patient can have a list of appointments and treatments tracked, helping healthcare providers deliver personalized care.

**Backend Architecture:**
- The backend is built using **Spring Boot**, ensuring efficient and maintainable code.
- **JPA (Java Persistence API)** is used to manage database operations, offering a clean and efficient way to interact with the PostgreSQL database.
- Each entity (Appointment, Doctor, Patient, and Hospital) is modeled as a separate class with appropriate relationships such as `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToMany` for linking data between entities.
- **RESTful APIs** are used to expose the systemâ€™s services, providing endpoints for CRUD operations on appointments, doctors, patients, and hospitals.

**Database:**
- The application uses **PostgreSQL** as the database, ensuring reliable and scalable data storage. It is configured to run locally on the development environment, and the database schema is managed using **Hibernate** to automatically generate and update database tables.

**API Endpoints:**
- **Appointment**: Create, read, update, and delete appointments.
- **Doctor**: Manage doctor details and appointments.
- **Hospital**: Manage hospital information and associated appointments.
- **Patient**: Manage patient records and appointments.

**Application Workflow:**
- **Add**: New records for doctors, patients, hospitals, and appointments can be added via POST requests.
- **View**: All records can be retrieved using GET requests, either individually or in bulk.
- **Delete**: Records can be deleted either individually or in bulk using DELETE requests.
- **Update**: Existing records can be updated using PUT requests.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Extend the system to handle billing, medical records, and more complex workflows.
- Spring Security Integration: Implement user authentication and authorization using Spring Security, ensuring secure access to sensitive endpoints for doctors, patients, and administrative staff.
- ResponseEntity for Every Class: Standardize responses across all endpoints using ResponseEntity, providing consistent status codes and messages in the API responses.

**Conclusion:**
This Hospital Management System efficiently streamlines hospital operations, improves appointment management, and optimizes communication between patients, doctors, and healthcare facilities. Built with **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**, it is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easily extended with additional features as needed.
